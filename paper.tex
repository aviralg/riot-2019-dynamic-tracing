Static analysis of R code is hard. A combination of dynamic typing, laziness
with side-effects, introspection, metaprogramming, first-class environments and
\code{eval} enable programming idioms that make it nearly impossible to
statically derive reliable insights. Fortunately, most of the R packages
available in CRAN and Bioconductor contain runnable programs in the form of
examples, tests and vignettes\footnote{The packages contain approximately 4.4M
lines of runnable R code} which makes the language well-suited for approaches
based on dynamic analysis.
%
However, currently there is no dynamic tracing functionality in R other than the
coarse-grained \code{trace} function which only allows tracing the entry and exit
points of R closures.

In this talk we present \RDT, a scalable and modular dynamic tracing framework
that exposes many aspects of R, facilitating a fine-grained inspection of
programs. It has two components:
%
\begin{compactitem}[$-$]
\item \emph{\RDyntrace} is a small extension\footnote{The complete extension to
  the virtual machine is about 1.8K lines of C code.} to GNU R Virtual Machine
  with probes that are triggered on specific program execution events. There are
  probes for function entry and exit, variable definition and
  mutation, garbage collection entry and exit, non-local jumps, promise
  creation and execution, eval entry and exit, and S3/S4 dispatch. \RDyntrace
  provides an API to register user-defined callbacks to these probes along with
  a facility to store arbitrary state per tracing session.
  %The ability to store tracing session state avoids the need to use
  %global variables and thus encourages a functional design of dynamic analysis
  %that is easier to reason about.
\item \emph{\dynalyzer} is a companion R package that provides utilities for
  building data-intensive dynamic analyses. The package facilitates quick
  construction of multistage pipeline for analysis of tracing data using the
  map-reduce programming model. It contains functions to automate logging and
  memoization of partially analyzed data from each stage. It also defines a
  data format for fast storage and retrieval of collected data with support for
  compression and streaming.
\end{compactitem}

%\bigskip
\indent An actual dynamic analysis is written as a standalone R package. Its
separation from the framework simplifies development and fosters reuse. The
package contains code that defines tracer state and registers callbacks for the
relevant events. When a callback is triggered, it receives the tracer state
together with the information about the event, \Ie, affected R objects along
with the relevant R interpreter state. \RDyntrace API exports utilities to access
fields of these objects as well as the global R interpreter state such as the
evaluation order of builtin function arguments and variable lookup without
triggering callbacks. Furthermore, \RDyntrace can detect nesting in callbacks,
a consequence of the tracing algorithm inadvertently executing R code that
potentially modifies the program state. This is a common stumbling block in
na\"ive tracing attempts and our design captures these cases, reporting them as
meaningful error message. There is also an escape hatch in the form of disabling
specific probes when the R code in question is known to be benign.

We have used \RDT for a large-scale study of the design and use of laziness in
R. Its design has enabled us to scale the dynamic analysis to 14,875 R packages,
tracking over 177.8 B promises and 3.5 T events at the rate of 1.5 M events per
second. The result is a comprehensive, data-oriented understanding of the role
of laziness in real-world R code.

\RDT enables a data-driven approach to understanding R program behavior and
language usage patterns. We believe this approach is instrumental in providing
insights for improving the design of existing features and driving the design of
new features and better libraries for the dynamic languages of today.
